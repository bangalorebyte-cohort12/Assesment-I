*Dataset Description:*

We have data of sales (in thousands of units) for a toothbrush company as a function of marketing budgets (in thousands of dollars) for TV, radio, and newspaper media. Suppose that in you role as statistical consultant you are asked to suggest, on the basis of this data, a marketing plan for next year that will result in high product sales. Specifically, how would you distribute the marketing budget of $100,000 next year in order to maximize toothbrush sales?

To answer this question, apply a linear regression and think of the following:

- How strong is the relationship between features Television, Radio,  Newspaper and predictor, Sales?
- Is their any interaction between the three platforms?

You have two tasks:

1) Split 20% of data into test data, minimize the Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE). The student with the lowest score is assigned a 100% score. 

2) Suggest how $100,000 of budget should be allocated across Television, Radio,  Newspaper in order to maximize sales.
